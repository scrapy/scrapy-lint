======================
SCP30: Removed setting
======================

What it does
============

Reports setting names that have been removed from package versions frozen in
your project requirements but do exist in lower versions of those packages.

It also reports the package that defined the setting, the version in which the
setting was deprecated, if it was deprecated before its removal, and the
version in which it was removed, so that you can check the corresponging
release notes for sunset guidance.

Sometimes sunset guidance is also provided in the error message.

Why is this bad?
================

Removed settings have stopped working the way they used to, and instead are
silently ignored.
